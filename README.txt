Egan Henderson Assignment 2 for COSC 3P98

To run the 2D hull peeler, open the folder called 2DHull, open EganHenderson_Assignment2.sln, then either press F5 or press the start button in Visual Studio to run it.
You may need to open 2DHull.cpp using the Solution Explorer if it does not open the first time the solution is loaded.

To run the 2D triangulator, open the folder called 2DTriangulation. Then follow the same steps as above, replace 2DHull.cpp with 2DTriangulation.cpp.

If there are any questions or problems with running the programs, please email me at eh17bq@brocku.ca
The 2D hull peel should not run into any problems from standard use.
There is an implementation of the cluster peels for the bonus question, but it is not complete.
The 2D triangulation will work most of the time. How well it works is up for debate currently.
There is a cleanup algorithm implemented, but it does not show any visual changes so please feel free to look at the code.

Here's a fun ASCII toad (different from last time :)):
